      <p>My Favorite character is Greninja from anime "Pokemon" just look at this thing isn't it cool.I recently played a pokemon game Pokemon Y and I chose Frokie as a starter which evolves into Greninja as i have such a good bonding with Greninja so my favorite character is Greninja also it has a really cool shiny form.It is a water and dark type pokemon which is effictive against fire,pshsic,rock,ground,ghost which is really good and is weak to fairy electric and bug that's it so it's really strong pokemon and cool too.</p>
